## Rationale
This game was made for a final project for an Introduction to Virtual Reality Systems class.
The goal of this game, aside from demonstrating what I have learned during this class, is to teach players how to build circuits in the context of computers.
Almost all of us use a computer or phone every day, yet relatively few people know how they work. At the fundamental level, computers work with simple logic gates that come together in complex ways. Although this game has very few levels, with more, this game would be able to introduce people to how circuits work, how numbers are represented and saved in computers, and how simple logic can turn into complex math.

## Installation
### Requirements
This project was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, so that headset is required.
Because this project is not on the Quest store, to download this project onto your headset, you need an Oculus developer account
and a wired connection from the headset to your computer.
To enable developer mode on your Quest, you will also need a mobile device with the Oculus app and a wireless connection to the headset.
You also need Unity 2019.4.34f

### Downloading the game
Once you have the requirements, follow these steps:

#### Enabling developer mode
1. Create an Oculus developer account: https://developer.oculus.com/
2. Download the Oculus app on a mobile phone
3. Log into your developer account on your Oculus Quest 2
4. Log into your developer account on the mobile app
5. Connect to your headset from the mobile app
6. Navigate in the mobile app to your Quest Device, then scroll down and click on "Developer Mode"
7. Enable Developer mode (this will allow you to download applications from unofficial sources

#### Installing the game
1. Download this GitHub repository
2. Open the Oculus Circuit Game with Unity 2019.4.34f
3. In the top bar of the window, click on File, then Build Settings
4. Connect your Quest headset to your computer
5. Click Build and Run. You can save the APK file anywhere on your computer
6. On the Oculus Quest 2, click Allow to allow your computer to access your Quest files
7. When the build is finished, the game should be running on your headset!
8. If the game did not automatically run, or if you closed out and would like to play the game, on your headset, open the Quest menu and go to your apps
9. In the top right corner, there should be a dropdown menu. By default, All is selected. Click on the dropdown menu
10. At the bottom of the dropdown menu, click on Unknown Sources
11. Click on the game, titled Into the Computer

## Future work
- Add more levels
- Make the Minecraft level-select scene more interactive and engaging
- Allow the user to build their own circuits
- Add in more complex gamified lessons
- Refactor code to make above tasks easier to complete
